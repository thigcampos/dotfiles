# Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration for a streamlined development environment.

## Wire
I use [Wire](https://github.com/thigcampos/wire) as my dotfiles manager. Wire helps manage and apply configurations efficiently across multiple machines.

## Usage
To set up your environment with these dotfiles, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the dotfiles repository
git clone https://github.com/thigcampos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Change to the dotfiles directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Run the setup script
zsh setup.zsh
```

Then, run `wire` to setup the desired packages.
